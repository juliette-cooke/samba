# SAMBA
## Description
SAMpling Biomarker Analysis is a toolset for running flux sampling on metabolic networks, predicting biomarkers 
(or metabolic profiles), and representing the results visually.

## Visuals
[add example plots here]

## Getting started
### Requirements
#### SAMBApy
- Python 3.7+
- cobrapy
- A solver (GLPK, CPLEX, GUROBI)
- Access to a computer cluster or powerful computer
#### SAMBAr
- R
- ggplot2

### Installation

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of 
usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
- [x] Add support for multiple KOs at once
- [ ] Add the option to reduce flux rates in addition to KO
